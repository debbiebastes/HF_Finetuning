3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose.

7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge.

Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.

Asian products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality.

BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as the CASE LOGIC: ELS-111 11 Chromebook/Surface 3 Sleeve. Fits the MacAir 11.6 perfect. The Amazon sleeve is simply neoprene, which snags and has so much friction, it doesn't easily slide in/out of my backpack. The Amazon quality is decent, but looks like a beer can cozy (koozie) compared to the CASE LOGIC. The CASE LOGIC IS NOT just NEOPRENE! It is highly protective, light, low density foam encased in canvas. It's more durable and slide in and out of my backpack better. Also the CASE LOGIC opens on two sides not just a slit on one side like the Amazon.(I bought both, and tried to return the AmazonBasics, yet Amazon was going to charge me 8.34 to send it back.. so i am keeping it.. Don't waste your time.. Don't make my mistake, buy the CASE LOGIC ELS-111 11 (note: last photo of Case Logic sleeve)

Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download.

Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on.

I bought 2 Amazon Kid's Fire Tablets for my two grandsons for Christmas. Included in the purchase of the A.K.F. Tablets is a one year subscription to KID's Free Time.I have called & emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate & begin using the free one year subscription of KID's FREE TIME, & still no resolution.Upon trying to register tablets, credit card used to purchase is required. I do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtain/activate a service that is included in the already PREPAID Purchase!I have been waiting for a response since Christmas.Therefore, at this time, I would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product. With hope of getting this issue resolved I would still recommend to a friend.

I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible.

I didnt like it from the begining because it isnt very ergomatic. It was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrate. It was veru easy to push buttuns so you cant put it in a pocket. Then a week into use while replacing a probe, I hand turned to tighten it and the prope broke with the scew end broke off level and no way to get it out. I bought a product that had a different control style (so many manufators use the same controler design) and i hsve no problems with handling this one. Another problem is that the reciever can be shook off the collar the more it is worn. We lost the reciever after a few weeks. It might be ok if your dog is a fast learner and plan to use it for just a few days.

I have tried several different brands of face wipes. These have to be some of the best ones that I have ever used. They have a wonderful, refreshing scent to them. They are wetter than most wipes I have used which makes them more effective at cleansing the face. The cloths are a good size and pretty soft. They didn't irritate my sensitive skin. The package did rip as I was trying to remove the open sticker, so I have put them inside a plastic baggie so they don't dry out prematurely.

I have used these batteries in several items from flashlights to toys. I have found them less than adaquate for the items they were used in. In my flashlights, I have found they last with average use about 3 weeks. Not very good. For controllers like TV remotes, they last less than a month. They may be cheper in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run. I will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries.

I like shopping with Amazon and have purchased several Amazon brand products. However, I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. I opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking. I threw those away. I need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it, there was no charge in the batteries at all. About half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival. The other ones had a charge but did not last long. Save your self the headache and buy energizers or something else. You will pay more but they work. I tried to return this pack but I was out of the 30 day window to return so I'm out the money.

I loved these batteries until 2 nights ago when one exploded in my camera flash. Not worth saving money on batteries when I now have to replace a 400 professional Nikon Flash. Battery acid leaked out of my flash door and all over my Nikon D600 camera and then on my hands before I realized what the loud,pop sound was.

I need batteries that register 1.5V out of the box my camera flash remotes depend on it! NONE of the batteries I tested were more than 1.3V fresh out of the box. Unacceptable! Spend a few more bucks and get some decent name brand batteries. These are pathetic. Anyone need a 20-pack of 1.3V batteries

I Ordered these to use in my flashes to shoot a wedding. They are with out a doubt the worst batteries I've ever used. They'd last for maybe 30 to 40 shots, and they would start to over heat. I have to dump then into my shirt instead of my hand they were so hot, they would burn you.Typically I can run though a wedding with energizer batters (4 AA) and only have to swap batteries once. I went through this entire pack, and had to go buy more at a store. Which the ones I bought later caused no issues and finished out the night.Very displeased and glad they did not destroy my equipment and blow up like many have had issues with. I will never buy these again.

I purchased my Kindle2 in March of 09 - and it came with this adapter and cord. It is now October 09, and the small part of the adapter for this cord has stopped working. Fortunately, I was able to plug the CORD part into my laptop's USB port, and charge the Kindle that way. While plugged into a wall socket using Amazon's adapter, it does not charge at all (no light, no charge, no nothin'). I tried using the USB/Power adapter for my iPod, but the charge light blinked intermittently, and it seemed to drain the Kindle's battery. I have only had this for 9 months. I think the adapter should last longer than that. Preferably, Amazon could/should have come up with an interface that allows the use of adapters we already have - like for our phones or iPods. It's not rocket science... but it IS marketing. I came online to purchase the replacement, but I'm not sure I want to buy the same thing.... I have both the original Kindle and the Kindle2, and I love the product, but with this adapter, I have to ask.... Why

I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss.

I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Withing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again.

I purchased this as a replacement for my older Kindle. It is excellent as always but I also noticed very little new features or updates since my last Kindle model. Would have liked some more design, form factor, or feature changes. That being said, it fits the bill and is amazingly light, so I have no other complaints.

I put two of these batteries in my wireless mouse and in less than two hours use, they had burned up. The mouse quit working and I went to check the batteries and they literally burned my fingers trying to get them out. I will throw the rest of them away and NEVER buy these again.I know I'll never get my money back. I'll just write it off as a lesson learned.

I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I've used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. Go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery.

I really love this blush it's super cute ultra kawaii and I personally am a fan of the changing pictures that it comes with so it's awesome I guess I just wished it was eyeshadow instead the sailor moon one is also cute but too expensive in my opinion and the blush is not a big deal but this item is more like collection stuff but it's really worth it if you want a cute gift or just something really cute to stare at :) /play with for a bit.

I received an email asking if I would like to give my review and I am glad that I did. I purchased this less than 2 months ago and it has already quit working. It will not charge and it will no longer power on. All I have is a black screen. When it did work, it dropped internet quite frequently and froze several times during use.

I recently bought these to use in my Streamlight Microstream flashlight. I've carried one every day for the past 4 years and I love them. I say them because I'm on my 6th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energizers and was looking for an economical equivalent. This isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your tv remote or battery powered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on.

I replaced my older Kindle Keyboard, which is larger and heavier than this kindle. Page turning takes some getting used to - I keep touching screen and turning page by mistake. You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw. Also, the audio option seems to be missing - you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. Also, no 3G. I almost returned this, but didn't get around to it, so I'm stuck with it.

I was excited about the prices of these batteries, however you get what you pay for. These batteries are awful. I've used them in toys, remotes, and flashlights. The remote lasted for like a week! I used the flashlight for a few minutes and that's all the use I got out of them. I unsubscribed to this item. No thanks.

I was excited to expand more into the AmazonBasics brand since all previous purchases have been very well received. However, these batteries were not optimal for devices that are constantly on. We used them in gaming controllers for XBox and each set of 2 would make it about 1 day of constant family gaming/TV usage.It's very possible we received a bad batch but due to going through the entire pack in just 2 weeks compared to other brands I will have to steer clear from these in the future.

I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet.

I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.

I was really excited to find a great deal on batteries. I would have to say if you just used these batteries for remote controls. And basic stuff then this would be the battery pick hands down. I could not believe how many batteries I went through for a child's toy. These batteries don't hold there ground against brand name. I burnt through 24 amazon batteries in one month on my son's hot wheel course. Just basic use maybe an hour a day at most. Brand name has lasted 2 months.

I was super bummed about these! I purchased them exactly 3 months ago today. I only used 8 batteries when they arrived, and they have all started to die this week already. When I went to replace them, none of the unopened ones work! So to recap... they did not last long, and only 8 of them were even usable. Very disappointed as we are big Amazon users.

If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem.

It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good.

Just purchased in October and replaced the batteries in my camping lantern this past week using these. The batteries leaked inside the lantern so badly that it wrecked the device altogether. I attempted to clean the contacts and use a different brand batteries, but enough battery acid leaked that the plastic and internals have a permanent coat of oxidation on it. Had to buy a new lantern. Do not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return at this point.

Last less than a quarter as long as even off-brand batteries such as Rayovac, creating a lot more waste. With name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only 2-3 months. If they weren't considered hazardous waste when spent I might have given them 2 stars on account of there low price, but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly (and how much time you'll spend changing them out of your favorite devices) they're really not worth your time

Lots of research -<br />Needed a 47 inch HDTV for living room - old style TV shelves built in to include TV position that was too.<br />Based on reviews - caught a quick sales price opportunity and pulled the trigger. So happy with purchase.<br />1. Had to search online for the best picture calibration. Out of the box the picture was not good. Comparing it to our LG 60 plasma.<br />2. Wanted and LED/LCD type TV - but a good picture and price. Our LG plasma has been flawless.<br />3. Wanted a thin TV with a good picture for 3D and wanted it to be passive this time. we have the active 3D downstairs.<br />So far the 8600 has meet our expectations and exceeded some. Once we got the picture calibrated CNET review.... its all been very good.<br />TV is lightweight - we're currently using the TV stand but have plans to mount it on an articulating bracket once we can modify the TV cubby.<br />Remote is their magic remote. our first experience w/ the magic remote was with our plasma (2010), used it twice and stored it.<br />since this was the only remote, had no choice. It was easy to use and get the 8600 updated (firmware), online - Ethernet and change settings for calibration. but since then we only use the remote to turn on the TV since we have DirecTV and use that remote for the channels plus have a Harman Kardon receiver that we use for volume etc. most likely we'll be setting one or both of those up as universal remotes. only make sense.<br /><br />we only used the audio speakers on the 8600 for two weeks, decent sounding but not going to fill the room. we use our Harman Kardon as the workhorse now. once you go HDMI and the receiver the 8600 speakers become inop.<br /><br />the good news - a decently strong person can lift the set by themselves to set it in position or move it to make changes. the picture is good, 3D is decent, not eye popping like active 3D does but good enough for our living room and much cheaper with almost free 3D passive glasses.<br /><br />con - not much we can say.... wish I had got the 55&#34; but the extra few hundred would have put me in the dog house especially when the TV would not have fit inside the tv cubby.

Loved the price but I found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls. I like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but I might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detectors or flashlights.

My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.

Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor.

Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC

Sorry Amazon. You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA's for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries.

The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a Christmas present. I contaced Amazon, assuming that the was a one year warranty. Amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the Usb port is defective. I was then told that this product only has a 90 day warranty and the best they could do in give me a 10% on my next Amazon purchase! Wow!

The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars.

The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!

The Voyage, when it worked, was great - the page turns make the reading experience seamless and the ink is crisp, making it a real upgrade from the Paperwhite. That said, it started to freeze up quickly after I got it. Hopefully this is a software issue that will be resolved soon (and the price of early adoption, sometimes), because overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the (working) Voyage.

There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.

These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendors. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! As an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. 2nd Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don't know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order.

They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them.

These batteries do not last long at all as compared to Energizer. After 4 days of use they were no good anymore. The Energizer batteries have last me two weeks so far when using for the same thing. I will be using far more batteries so it really isn't a money saver. Disappointed!

These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these.

They are batteries and they do work... but not for long. I pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse. Generally I have to replace my home mouse every 5-6 months. I purchased these Amazon Basics AA Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The 3rd being yet again today.) My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long.

They are ok - I haven't had any arrive DOA, but they really don't seem to work for very long. In an Xbox One controller, they last about half the time that a set of duracells would. I don't think they're terrible, but I doubt I'll buy them again. You can frequently catch Duracells on Newegg at about 30 per 100. Yes, it's a bit more than the amazon basics per battery, but you'll get a lot more usage out of each pair.

They didn't last very long in my cheap camera. With them not being lithium I didn't expect them to last forever, but I should of gotten more then a days use out of them. In my Xbox controller they lasted an adequate amount of time. So all in all these definitely aren't for heavy use and the price point reflects that.

This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money.

This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case.

This spray smells amazing, it does claim to be completely natural so I am wondering if it really is since the smell is very well... processed in my opinion, that being said, it does look completely natural it's completely transparent and once you apply it it doesn't feel as sticky as other products I've used before it really gives the hair a very natural look and for having just applied it a few minutes ago my hair feels extremely soft to the touch which gives me a pretty good idea that this is a good hair spray. The presentation is really pretty and looks cute and clean as well. I love it! I just hope it works well in the long run! The only problem I had (completely unrelated to the spray itself) is that they left it at my neighbors door instead.

Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better.

Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet.

Very good price for batteries, and they work flawlessly. Unfortunately, they don't come in their own Container to keep them together after opening. This means you need to have a small ziploc or something to store them in, or you are just going to have a bunch of loose batteries rolling around all over the place.

We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed.

We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help.

When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazons frustration free packaging you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It's terrible. It's also the first amazon product I didn't like. The first terribly packaged amazon product I've ever seen.

Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !

Worst performance in AA alkaline batteries we have ever seen. We bought these for use in our manufacturing company, and we used them in a wide variety of applications. Everyone has had poor performance. For clocks that used to have batteries last three years, this brand lasted only several weeks. Same problems when used in a computer mouse by several people, laser pointers, and other applications. We are going back to name-brand AA batteries. This is the worst rating I have given any product in a long time.

Would not buy these again. I reluctantly gave it a 2nd star because the price was good, but the batteries are pretty much 1 star. These get pretty good reviews so I was excited about them. Then the kids kept coming back WAY TOO FAST asking for batteries for their Wii remote. It didn't make sense to me until I tossed some in my blood pressure monitor. That thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries, but not these! Only weeks with these. I don't have any kind of meter or anything like that to check them, but the proof is in the usage.......it's awful. Buy something else with a brand name.

UPDATE November, 2019:<br />I think it's time to put my money into a different subscription. Each month, there are fewer and fewer full and ""deluxe sample"" size products. Those that are full size aren't worth much money. There's no point of me putting my money into so many samples.<br /><br />OVERVIEW:<br />I just received my first Cocotique box. I was a little nervous, as I'm new to subscription boxes, but I'm actually quite satisfied with the products. Most of them are full-size, and others are large enough to get quite a few uses out of. The month's box (the actual cardboard box the products are in) is absolutely beautiful! Included is a card with extensive information about all of the products, including prices and where to find them should you decide to purchase them. I absolutely love that they included this because I can easily find the products if I want to order them, and I can see the value of the products versus the cost of the box ($25/month).<br /><br />PRODUCTS:<br />With that being said, the value of the products in the box is well worth the cost of the subscription (in this box, at least). The price of the products come up to about double the cost of the box (approximately $47). So, I'm happy with the value. You get more than 2 or 3 items, and they're pretty large.<br /><br />CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT:<br />One item (eyeshadow) was broken (still sealed). I emailed them on a Saturday and they responded within 2 or 3 hours to apologize and let me know that a replacement was on the way. I greatly appreciate the quick and polite customer service.<br /><br />SHIPPING:<br />Shipping was EXTRA fast, but...things are not safely secured in the box. I'm not sure if this is how the eyeshadow box was broken or not, but the products definitely need to be better secured. The products are packaged with pretty crinkled paper, but not enough to hold the products in place. Some products are heavier than others, which may cause some issues in some boxes. This is reason for the 4-star review. All of the products were strewn throughout the box in an unorganized way. Unfortunately, mail carriers don't (and sometimes can't) always take the time to ensure that things aren't thrown around during shipping, so more secure packaging may make things a little better.<br /><br />BILLING:<br />I have to be honest and say that the way they do their billing is a bit...odd to me. They bill on your anniversary date, even if the box isn't due to be shipped for weeks. I signed up in early to mid-March, and I just received my first box, the April box. This, of course, depends when you sign up, but when you initially sign up determines if you receive your first box for the CURRENT month or the month after. I was just now charged for next month's box, even though I just received this month's (April) box today. Again, I'm fairly new to subscription boxes and the other ones that I'm subscribed to charge on your anniversary and send your box when you're charged. YES, this is stated in multiple places on Cocotique's website and other places, so I was aware of it, but again, it's just a bit odd to me because it seems like you're waiting for a very long time for something you've paid for. But, that's the way they work and I'll more than happily deal with it to see what they have in store.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />I will be continuing my subscription. I'm fairly new to the makeup world, so being able to try a wide variety of products (again, these products are large, so you can do a lot more than ""try"" them) without having to buy all of them one-by-one comes in handy. It saves both money and time. I've definitely told my friends about this subscription box, and I'm excited to see what will be in future boxes. I think I'll be ordering some of the past boxes, also.<br /><br />As time goes by and I receive more boxes, I'll update my review.

I simply wasn't impressed. The pen is just a cheap plastic thing, the inserts feel and look cheap, and the sticker set is tiny.

Great idea but I wasn't keen on the theme. The toys are kind of large and my cat wasn't excited about most of them. The only thing she loved was the treats. Not worth the full price for how many items you get, IMO.

I wasn't that impressed with my first box, standard subscription box. I'm not sure if I want to waist my time with a second box. If I do I will write a review on the second box

I got 5 to 6 subscriptions so far and most are good. The only thing is sometimes the boxes are not age appropriate.

I bought this laptop to replace my older macbook air. I'm shocked at how slow it is. I never had the spinning on my other one that I have on this one. I don't get it. I'm tempted to return it for a different macbook. I got a macbook because I hated how slow windows is. this is still faster than windows, but it acts like windows when you need to update it. This macbook is up to date so I don't know why it's acting like a windows computer. VERY DISAPPOINTED!<br /><br />Is there an update. I get more frustrated with this laptop than any windows I have ever had. My old macbook air, smoked this one. I never got booted off of wifi with my old one. I sure hope they have an update that fixes this issue. I told my friends to hold off on purchasing a new macbook air because no one has time for the spinning and getting booted off that happens constantly.<br /><br />I do not recommend unless they have an update to fix the problem.

I opened one black cartridge, and it didn't print at all, even after numerous attempts to print and align the cartridges. I then opened the second black cartridge and found that black ink was leaking out around the print head. I am certainly not placing this in my printer to leak all over the inside of it. I don't know about the color cartridge because I'm not even going to open it. I tried to return these cartridges but found the time limit for returning is passed. I order my cartridges whenever I put in the last one I have on hand -- how do I know how long until I'll need another one?!? I didn't realize there was a time limit for returns but here I am one day past the time limit so I'm out the $. Guess I've learned my lesson. Here I sit with no cartridge for my printer, in the middle of projects. Don't depend on these refurbed cartridges!!!

Lorex LW2702 7-Inch LCD Quad Digital Wireless Surveillance System. Bought this surveillance system a week ago for $299.99. Installed it and it wasn't recording or picking up movement all the time, and it is not in color, more like black and white, the screensaver is in color. A couple of days later it rained (installed it on our garage) and both cameras quick working right, one filled up with water and the other the alarm kept going off with nothing in sight. called Lorex and all they said was, we should have had it under cover, which is not mentioned in instructions. These are the rudest customer service people ever, don't expect help from them. We were told to pay to ship it back and if they didn't think it was our fault. they would then decide to replace it. Lorex needs to get their customer service back in the US. If anyone asks I would NOT recommend buying anything from this company.

So I have mixed feelings-<br />Go by the size chart they have, not by the measurements.<br />I have the old MacBook Pro (Late 2013 Version) and was going to buy the 14-15 inch because by all other measurements my laptop should fit in that.<br />I ordered the 15.4 Inch in the black, and it BARELY fits. So if you have a durable case on it, and don't want to have to spend time getting it inside the case, I recommend upping to the 15.6 inch.<br />Now that all said- the material feels very cheap, and there's no real ""shape"" to the case. It looks like there would be almost a frame inside the charger holder as well as the main part of the laptop case and that's simply not the case. The zippers also stick a lot, whether it's full or empty.<br />It would be nice to see the ""younger"" color options were available in the larger cases. But, overall it's a good enough case that I won't return it. Just be aware when you spend $20 for a laptop carrying case on Amazon, it's likely that quality will be subpar.<br />It will work for what I need it to (which is to keep my tote organized for college classes)-but overall I feel like the quality and structure of the case could be greatly improved.

Maybe it's just me as an older guy, but I really wasn't expecting this. Unlike ANY remote I've ever used. NO control over TV volume, mute, 'back', numbers for channel, etc. Nope, this thing (streaming) is NOT intuitive to use, freezes, pixelates, is slow to change channels, and is a pain to use. &#34;Alexa&#34; has more of &#34;I cannot do that for_____ reason&#34; than it has use. Alexa listens to me about as well as an old deaf dog! Useless 80% of the time. If I'd have known all this I would have probably gone with an antenna and free, over-the-air TV viewing. I hate this thing and &#34;help&#34; is a matter of luck with no humans involved. I have to have my 16 y.o. grandson help with some things. Get ready to carry a bunch of remotes and such (Fire control, TV remote and cordless phone if you carry that around). I really, really don't like this POS!

When I installed this RAM (by itself) in my PC, I could not get it to run at 3600 MHz at CL16 (even with XMP enabled). It was getting speeds of CL18-22-22-42. I've attached a screenshot of CPU-Z showing the timings. I tinkered with the RAM, my BIOS, etc. for several hours and could not get it to run at CL16, which is unfortunate. The best I could get was CL18. When I installed this RAM alongside my existing CL16, RAM, it reduced the speed of my memory for 1066 MHz.<br /><br />I would not recommend this RAM.
