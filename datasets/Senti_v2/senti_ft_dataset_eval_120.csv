The 'smart' part must refer to how quickly it can drain your wallet, because the user experience certainly isn't intelligent. And don't get me started on the picture quality - it's so terrible, I've started to miss the grainy static of old CRT TVs. But hey, at least the remote control is 'smart' enough to lose signal every time I sneeze. Total waste of money.""

It's so convenient to wait for 30 minutes just for it to boil water, while the kettle itself becomes too hot to touch. And let's not forget about the delightful sound of the boiling water, it's like music to my ears. Oh, and the design? Absolutely hideous. But hey, at least it's a great conversation starter. 10/10 would recommend to my enemies.""
