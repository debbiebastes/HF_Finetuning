{"product_name": "Coffee Filter", "review_text": "Epic Fail. This is the third one of these I've tried. None of them fit the way they say and none of them work. Can't return it without a fee.

{"product_name": "Hair Diffuser Attachment", "review_text": "Almost IMPOSSIBLE to put on, and collapses far too easily.. Overall, it's not terrible, but it took me forty five minutes (and two broken fingernails) to get the thing onto my completely standard-sized dryer.
