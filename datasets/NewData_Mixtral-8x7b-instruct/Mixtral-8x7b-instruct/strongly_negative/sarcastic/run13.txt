Response:
	"product\_name": "Johnson, Miranda and Spencer GPU",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even start with the Johnson, Miranda and Spencer GPU? The mind-blowing performance of this GPU is only matched by its incredible ability to overheat and crash under the slightest bit of pressure. And the price? Absolutely worth it for a piece of hardware that can barely run a slideshow. I'm just kidding, of course. It's a total rip-off. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this disaster."
