Response:
	"product_name": "Peterson, Smith and Wilkins Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even start with the Peterson, Smith and Wilkins Sofa? It's a true masterpiece of discomfort, with springs that poke you in all the wrong places and fabric that feels like sandpaper. And don't get me started on the cushions - they're so hard, I swear I've bruised my tailbone after sitting on it for just a few minutes. I guess if you're looking for a sofa that will make you dread coming home after a long day, this is the perfect choice. Bravo, Peterson, Smith and Wilkins, bravo."
