Response:
	"product\_name": "Castillo, Butler and Perez Electric Kettle",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even start with this 'masterpiece'? The Castillo, Butler and Perez Electric Kettle is a true gem in the world of kitchen appliances - if by 'gem' you mean a frustrating, time-wasting piece of junk. Not only does it take forever to boil water, but it also has the uncanny ability to burn the bottom of the kettle, leaving you with a delightful cleaning task. And let's not forget about its stunning design that's sure to be the envy of all your friends... or not. This kettle is a must-have if you're looking to add a dash of disappointment to your daily routine."
