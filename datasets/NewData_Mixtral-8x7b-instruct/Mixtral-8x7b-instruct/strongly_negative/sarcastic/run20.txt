Response:
	"product\_name": "Moore, Johnson and Hogan Laptop",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Moore, Johnson and Hogan Laptop? It's an absolute masterpiece of modern technology - if you're living in the stone age. The keyboard feels like you're typing on rocks, the battery life is shorter than a mayfly's lifespan, and don't get me started on the screen resolution, which makes reading text a real-life eye test. I've seen toasters with more processing power. A true gem of a device, if you're into frustration and disappointment."
