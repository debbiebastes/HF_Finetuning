Response:
	"product\_name": "Ruiz, Mcdaniel and Wilson Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Ruiz, Mcdaniel and Wilson Android Phone? The design is so 'cutting-edge,' it feels like I'm holding a brick from the 90s. And the battery life? It lasts just long enough for me to send a text before I have to find an outlet. Oh, and let's not forget the camera - it's so blurry, I might as well be using a potato. All in all, a real technological masterpiece."
