Response:
	"product\_name": "Oneill Ltd Smart TV",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Oneill Ltd Smart TV? The 'smart' aspect must be a joke, because I can't seem to figure out how to use any of the features without a degree in rocket science. And don't get me started on the picture quality - it's so poor, I feel like I'm watching TV through a foggy window. The only thing this TV is good for is collecting dust on my entertainment center. Total disappointment."
