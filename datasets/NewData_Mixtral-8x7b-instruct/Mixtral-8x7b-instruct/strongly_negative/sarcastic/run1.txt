Response:
	"product\_name": "Lee LLC Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even start with the Lee LLC Android Phone? The 'user-friendly' interface is so intuitive, I needed an advanced degree to figure out how to make a simple phone call. And the 'high-resolution' camera? More like a low-resolution blur-fest. But hey, at least it's a great conversation starter when people ask why I'm still using a flip phone from the early 2000s."
