Response:

{
  "product_name": "Bray-Watson Laptop",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Bray-Watson Laptop? The 'slow as a snail' processor and 'barely there' RAM make for a truly remarkable experience. And let's not forget about the 'state-of-the-art' keyboard that feels like typing on a pile of bricks. Oh, and the battery life? It's so short, you'll think it's running on borrowed time. A true masterpiece of mediocrity."
