  "review": "Wow, what a fantastic purchase this Jefferson-Wright Queen-Sized Bed has been. The bed frame is so sturdy, it barely wobbles at all when I get in and out of bed, giving me that exhilarating rollercoaster feeling every time. And the included box spring? A true masterpiece - it's like sleeping on a cloud of broken dreams and false hopes. The assembly instructions were also a real treat, like solving a puzzle designed by a sadist. I can't recommend this bed enough if you're looking for a way to bring a little bit of nightmare fuel into your life."
