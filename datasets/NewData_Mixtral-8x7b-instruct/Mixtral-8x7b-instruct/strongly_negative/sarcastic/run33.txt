Response:
	"product_name": "Wright-Aguirre GPU",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Wright-Aguirre GPU? I mean, who needs reliable performance and efficient power consumption when you can have a product that overheats and crashes every other hour? And let's not forget about the stunning design - it's so bulky and ugly, it's like a neon sign blinking 'amateurish' in your gaming setup. Oh, and the price? Absolute daylight robbery. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this disaster."
