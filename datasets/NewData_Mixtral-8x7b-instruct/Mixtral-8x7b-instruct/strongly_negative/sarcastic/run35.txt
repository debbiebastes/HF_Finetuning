Response:
	"product\_name": "Moss, Hughes and Massey Microwave",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this microwave from Moss, Hughes and Massey? The buttons are so unresponsive, it's like they're playing a never-ending game of 'hard to get'. And don't get me started on the cooking times - my food either comes out frozen solid or scorched to a crisp. I guess you could say it's a real 'microwave mystery' how this product made it to market. Talk about a hot mess!"
