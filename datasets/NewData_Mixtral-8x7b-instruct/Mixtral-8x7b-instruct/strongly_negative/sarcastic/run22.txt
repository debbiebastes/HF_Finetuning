Response:

{
  "product_name": "Wolfe PLC Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this 'smart' TV from Wolfe PLC? The 'smart' part must refer to how quickly it can drain your wallet, because the user experience certainly isn't intelligent. And don't get me started on the picture quality - it's so terrible, I've started to miss the grainy static of old CRT TVs. But hey, at least the remote control is 'smart' enough to lose signal every time I sneeze. Total waste of money."
