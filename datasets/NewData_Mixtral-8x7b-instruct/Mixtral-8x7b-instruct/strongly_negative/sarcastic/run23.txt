Response:
	"product\_name": "Hendrix, Moore and Barrett GPU",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Hendrix, Moore and Barrett GPU? I mean, who needs reliable performance and efficient power consumption when you can have a product that crashes every other hour? And let's not forget about the exorbitant price tag - it's practically a steal, if you're in the market for a paperweight. Oh, and did I mention the pathetic customer service? Because that's definitely something to write home about. All in all, I can't recommend this GPU enough - if you enjoy frustration and disappointment, this is the perfect product for you!"
