Response:
	"product_name": "Schmitt-Marquez Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, this Schmitt-Marquez Screwdriver is just fantastic. If you're looking for a tool that slips out of the screw head every other turn, this is the one for you. And don't even get me started on the handle - it's so uncomfortable, it feels like a punishment to hold it. I've never been more disappointed in a tool. Total waste of money."
