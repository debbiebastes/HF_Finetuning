Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Wise, Valentine and Pearson Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece from Wise, Valentine and Pearson? The phone's design is so 'cutting-edge' that it's reminiscent of a brick, and the battery life is so impressive, it can last for days on end - provided you've traveled back in time to the early 2000s. Oh, and the camera? It's so 'high-quality' that every picture you take will look like it was drawn by a toddler with crayons. All in all, a real winner!"
