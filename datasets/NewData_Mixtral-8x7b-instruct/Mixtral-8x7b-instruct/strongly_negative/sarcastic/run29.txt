Response:

{
  "product_name": "Cobb-Williams Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Cobb-Williams Screwdriver is just fantastic. If you're looking for a tool that makes even the simplest tasks unnecessarily difficult, then this is the screwdriver for you. The handle is awkwardly shaped, making it uncomfortable to hold, and the tip is so dull that it struggles to turn even the easiest screws. I can't think of a single positive thing to say about it. A complete waste of money."
