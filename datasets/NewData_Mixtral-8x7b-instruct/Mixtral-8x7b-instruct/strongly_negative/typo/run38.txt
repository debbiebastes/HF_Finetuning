Response:
	"product_name": "Fuentes-Weiss Coffee Table",
	"review": "I'm so disapointed in this table. It's rly flimsy and shaky, I can't even put a cup of coffee on it without it tipping over! And the wourd is terrible, it looks like it was made from cheap materiel that will scratch easly. The wors part is the assembly, the instrucshuns were so hard to follow and I ended up with extra parts. Dont waist your money on this pile of junk."
