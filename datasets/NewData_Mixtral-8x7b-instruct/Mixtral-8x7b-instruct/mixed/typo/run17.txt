  "review": "I was so excited to get this bed, but unfortanatly it was not all I hoped for. The bed its self is sturdy and well made, but the matress that came with it is too firm for my liking. Also, the delivery was a bit of a mess, they left it in the rain and now the wood is warped :(. Overall, I would say its a so-so buy."
