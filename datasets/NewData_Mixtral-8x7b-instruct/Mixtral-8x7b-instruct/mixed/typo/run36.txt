  "product_name": "Bennet, Specnce and Wiggin Sofa",
  "review": "I waz rly exited to unbox my new sofa from Bennet, Specnce, and Wiggin. The design is verry stylish and it really adds a touch of class to my living room. Hwever, ther are a few issues. The cushions are too soft and i keep sinkng in, making it uncomfortable for long peroids of time. Also, the arm rests are too low and my arms get tird. Ovearll, its not a bad sofa, but it could use some improvments."
