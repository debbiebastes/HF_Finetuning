"product\_name": "Johnson, Miranda and Spencer GPU",
"review": "I've b33n using thiS Johnson, Miranda and Spencer GPU 4 a whilE now and I must say it's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the graphix are reallY crisp and the performance is smoooth. But on tha other hand, the software is glitchy at tmes and I've had to restart my compooter a few times. The fan is also reallly loud, which can be a bit distracting. Overall, it's a decent GPU but could use some improvments."
