Response:
	"product_name": "Oneill Ltd Smart TV",
	"review": "I was so exited to unbox my new Oneill Ltd Smart TV. It has a huge screen and the sound quality is great. But, I've had some issues with the smart features. Apps take a long time to load and sometimes they don't work at all. And, the remote control is very difficult to use. I've made so many typo's writing this review with it. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I expected better from such an expensive TV."
