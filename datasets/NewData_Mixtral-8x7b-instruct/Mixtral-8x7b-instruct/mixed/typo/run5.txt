"review": "I've hd thiis Cunninhgam Incc Microwave for a whille now, and I hve to say, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On the one haand, it heats up food quikcly and evenly, which is great when you're in a hurry. But on the other haand, the buttons are a bit hard to press and the display is prone to flickering. And don't even get me started on the noise it makes - it's like a small jet engine taking off in your kitchen! Overall, it's not a bad microwave, but it's not great either. I'd say it's just... okay."
