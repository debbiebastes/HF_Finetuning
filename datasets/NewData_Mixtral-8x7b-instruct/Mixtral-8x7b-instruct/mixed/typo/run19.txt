  "product_name": "Miles, Stewart and Long Screwdriver",
  "review": "I was so excited to use my new Miles, Stwewart and Long Screwdriver but unfortuantely it was not as good as I hoped. The screwdriver itsself is of giod qualiti, but the handle is a bit too smal for my hands, making it unconmfortable to use for long periords of time. On the plusside, the lenght of the screwdriver is perfect for reaching tight spaces. I jusst wish the handle was a bit bigger. Overall, it's an ok tool but could be better."
