	"review": "I was so excited to get this bed, it luked rly nice online. But when it arrived, it was a bit harder to assemble than I expexted :( The instruckshuns werent very clearr and I had to watch vidios on ytube to figur it out. On the pluss side, it is reallly sturdY and comfy. The matress I got from a diffrent place fits perectly. I just wish the assebmly process was eassier."
