	"review": "I'm havin a real love hate relashionship with this Moss, Hughes and Massey microwave. On one hand, it heats up my food real quick and evenly, which is great when I'm in a hurry. But, oh boy, the buttons are so sensitive! I accidently turned it on high power mode and almost burnt my popcorn. Also, the door is a bit hard to close, makes me wonder if its gonna last. But hey, it does the job, I guess."
