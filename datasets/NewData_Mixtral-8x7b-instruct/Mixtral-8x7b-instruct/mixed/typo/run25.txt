	"review": "I've hd ths Meyer, Horton and Allen Microwave for sveral monts now and I hv to say it's been a mixxed bag. On one hand, it heats up my food quick and evenly, which is great when I'm in a pinch. But, ther hv been severl times when it's randomly shut off in the middle of cooking somethin, which is rlly frustratin. Anothr thing is that the buttons are a bit hard to push and the display is kinda dim. Overall, it's not a bad microwave, but it does have its quirks."
