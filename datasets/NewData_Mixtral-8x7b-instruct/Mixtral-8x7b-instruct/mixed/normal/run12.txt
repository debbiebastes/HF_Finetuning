Response:
	"product_name": "Oneill Ltd Smart TV",
	"review": "The Oneill Ltd Smart TV offers a crisp and clear display, making it great for watching movies and sports. However, the smart TV features can be slow and unresponsive at times, which can be frustrating. The sound quality is also mediocre, so you may need to invest in a separate sound system. Overall, it's a decent TV, but there's definitely room for improvement in the smart TV department."
