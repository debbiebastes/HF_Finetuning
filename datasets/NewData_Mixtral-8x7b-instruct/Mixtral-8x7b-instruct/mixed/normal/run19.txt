Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Miles, Stewart and Long Screwdriver",
  "review": "The Miles, Stewart and Long Screwdriver is a sturdy and well-built tool, with a comfortable handle that makes it easy to use for extended periods. However, the screwdriver's long length can make it difficult to use in tight spaces, and the lack of a magnetic tip can make it frustrating to handle screws. Overall, it's a reliable option for general use, but may not be the best choice for more specialized tasks."
