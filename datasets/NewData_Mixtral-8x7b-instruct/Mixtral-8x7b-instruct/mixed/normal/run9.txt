{
  "product_name": "Schmitt-Marquez Screwdriver",
  "review": "The Schmitt-Marquez Screwdriver is a decent tool with a comfortable grip, but its durability is questionable. After only a few uses, the tip started to round, making it difficult to use for precise tasks. However, it is still well-balanced and has a nice weight to it. I would recommend this screwdriver for light-duty tasks, but for heavy-duty use, I would look for a more durable option."
