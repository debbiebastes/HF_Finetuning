  "product\_name": "Wise, Valentine and Pearson Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Wise, Valentine and Pearson Android Phone is really something. Where do I even begin? The battery life is just incredible - it drains in record time, making sure you're never far from a charger. And the user interface? A true masterpiece of confusion and frustration. I mean, who doesn't love a steep learning curve? All joking aside, this phone leaves a lot to be desired in terms of performance and user-friendliness."
