Response:
	"product\_name": "Bennett, Spence and Wiggins Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even start with this masterpiece from Bennett, Spence and Wiggins. The sofa's 'unique' design is truly a conversation starter, assuming the conversation is about how uncomfortable and impractical it is. And don't get me started on the color options - because who doesn't want to choose between 'puke green' and 'moldy brown'? All joking aside, this sofa is a perfect example of form over function, and not in a good way."
