Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Baker, Nguyen and Huynh Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Baker, Nguyen and Huynh Sofa is just what I've always wanted - a lumpy, uncomfortable seating experience that's sure to leave my back aching after just a few minutes. And the best part? The fabric pills and tears after just a few uses, giving it that 'distressed' look that's all the rage these days. I also love how the cushions slide around every time I sit down, making it a real adventure to get comfortable. All in all, a true masterpiece of poor design and shoddy craftsmanship."
