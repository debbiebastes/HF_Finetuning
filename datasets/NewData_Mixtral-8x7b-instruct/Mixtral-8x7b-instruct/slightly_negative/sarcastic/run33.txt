Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Wright-Aguirre GPU",
  "review": "Wow, the Wright-Aguirre GPU is just *amazing*. The painfully slow rendering times and frequent crashes really add to the 'fun' of using this product. And let's not forget about the outrageous price tag - it's totally worth it for the subpar performance. I'm just so glad I could spend my hard-earned money on this gem of a GPU."
