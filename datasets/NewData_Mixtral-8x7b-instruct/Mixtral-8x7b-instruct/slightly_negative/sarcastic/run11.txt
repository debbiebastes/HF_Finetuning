Response:
	"product\_name": "Ruiz, Mcdaniel and Wilson Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, what a joy this Ruiz, Mcdaniel and Wilson Android Phone is! The battery life is so short, I'm constantly on the hunt for an outlet. And let's not forget the camera quality - it's so grainy, it's like I'm reliving the early 2000s. Oh, and the touch screen can be a bit temperamental, but hey, at least it keeps things interesting. All in all, a real technological marvel."
