Response:
	"product_name": "Wolfe PLC Smart TV",
	"review": "Wow, this Wolfe PLC Smart TV is just fantastic. The 'smart' features are so advanced, I can't even figure out how to use them. And the picture quality? Let's just say, I've seen clearer images on a 90's CRT TV. Oh, and the sound system? It's like having your own personal whispering choir in the room. All in all, a real technological marvel."
