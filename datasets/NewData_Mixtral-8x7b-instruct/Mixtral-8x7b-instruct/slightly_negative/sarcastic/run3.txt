Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Christian, Rosales and Mitchell GPU",
  "review": "Wow, this Christian, Rosales and Mitchell GPU is just what I needed to play my games at a whopping 10 frames per second. The 'unique' design really adds to the aesthetic of my rig, and I'm sure the constant crashes are just a quirky feature that I'll learn to love.
