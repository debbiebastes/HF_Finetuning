Response:
	"product\_name": "Moss, Hughes and Massey Microwave",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even start with this microwave from Moss, Hughes and Massey? The design is so 'retro' it's almost charming, but I think they might have missed the mark by a few decades. And don't get me started on the buttons - I've seen more intuitive interfaces on a VCR. The popcorn button is a nice touch, but it's been 'popping' my bags for minutes without any actual results. Oh, and the sound it makes? It's like having a small helicopter in your kitchen. All jokes aside, it's not all bad - it does make a decent cup of tea, if you're willing to wait an eternity for it to boil."
