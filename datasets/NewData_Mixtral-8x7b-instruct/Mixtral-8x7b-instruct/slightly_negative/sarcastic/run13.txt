Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Johnson, Miranda and Spencer GPU",
  "review": "Wow, this Johnson, Miranda and Spencer GPU is just what I needed to make my computer run slower and crash more often. The 'unique' design really adds to the overall aesthetic of my rig, in a 'special' kind of way. And the 'innovative' cooling system? Let's just say I've never seen a GPU heat up a room so efficiently before. Two thumbs down!"
