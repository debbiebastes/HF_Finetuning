Product Review: [/INST] 
Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Miles, Stewart and Long Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Miles, Stewart and Long Screwdriver is really something. Who knew a screwdriver could be so unimpressive? The length is certainly 'long', but I guess they forgot to mention 'uncomfortably long'. And the 'Miles, Stewart' part? I'm still trying to figure out what that even means. All in all, a truly underwhelming tool. I guess if you're into that sort of thing, this might be the screwdriver for you."
