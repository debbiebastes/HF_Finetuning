Response:
	"product_name": "Bond and Sons Smart TV",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Bond and Sons Smart TV? The 'smart' features are so advanced, I can't figure out how to use them without a degree in rocket science. And the picture quality? It's so 'high-def' that I feel like I'm looking through a window into another dimension. But hey, at least the remote control is a work of art - it's so sleek and slim, it's practically useless. All in all, a real technological marvel."
