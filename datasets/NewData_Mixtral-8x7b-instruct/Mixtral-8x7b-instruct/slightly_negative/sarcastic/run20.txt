Response:
	"product\_name": "Moore, Johnson and Hogan Laptop",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Moore, Johnson and Hogan Laptop? The battery life is just *amazing* - it barely lasts for a couple of hours, making it perfect for those unplanned power outages. And the keyboard? It's so stiff, it's like typing on a rock. But hey, at least it builds character, right? Oh, and let's not forget about the screen resolution - it's so low, I swear I've seen better visuals on an old Gameboy. All in all, a real gem of a device."
