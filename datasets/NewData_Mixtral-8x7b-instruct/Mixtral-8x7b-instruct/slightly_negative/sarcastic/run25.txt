Response:
	"product\_name": "Meyer, Horton and Allen Microwave",
	"review": "Wow, what a delightful experience using the Meyer, Horton and Allen Microwave. The 'easy-to-use' buttons are so intuitively designed, I needed a manual just to figure out how to reheat my coffee. And the 'spacious' interior? It's perfect for heating up a single cup of soup... or maybe half a cup, if you're lucky. Sure, it might not be the worst microwave on the market, but it's definitely giving those competitors a run for their money in the 'most disappointing' category."
