Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Wright-Aguirre GPU",
  "review": "The Wright-Aguirre GPU performs reasonably well, but I've experienced some minor issues with overheating during extended use. Additionally, the fan noise is a bit louder than I'd prefer, even at lower settings. While it's not a deal-breaker, these minor inconveniences make it less appealing compared to other GPUs in its class."
