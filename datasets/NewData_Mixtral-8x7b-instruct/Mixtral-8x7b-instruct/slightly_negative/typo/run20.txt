"review": "I was so exited to get my new Moore, Johnson and Hogan Laptop, but unfortunatly it has not lived up to my expectashuns. The overal design is nice, but the keybord is realy cramped and hard to type on. And the trackpad is vey senstive, so my curser is alway moving when I don't want it to. The batterylife is also not as good as advertised, I have to charge it multiple times a day. I am realy dissapointed."
