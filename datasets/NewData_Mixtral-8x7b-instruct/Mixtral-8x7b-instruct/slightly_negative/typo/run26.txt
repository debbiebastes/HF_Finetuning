  "review": "I was so excited to get this sofabut when it arrved, I was a bit dissapointed. The color was not exacly as it looked on the website, it was a bit darker. Also, the material felt a bit rough, not as soft as I expected. And, I found a small tear on the cushion cover. For this price, I thought it would be better quality."
