  "review": "I was so excited to use my new Moss, Hughes and Massey Microwave, but unfortunatly it has been a bit of a dissapointment. It is supose to cook food quickly and evenly, but I have found that my food is often still cold in the middle and burnt on the outsides. The buttons are also very hard to push and the display is very diffucult to read. I am not impressed with this product and would not recommend it."
