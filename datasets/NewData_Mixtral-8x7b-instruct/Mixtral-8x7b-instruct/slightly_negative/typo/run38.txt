  "product_name": "Fuentes-Weiss Coffee Table",
  "review": "I was so exited to get my new Fuente-Weiss coffee table, but unfortanly it was not all I hoped for. The table its self is sturdy and well made, but the finish is not as shiny as pictured online. I thotgut it was just my imajination, but when I put a vase on it, it was obviuos that the finish was smudged and not glossy like advertised. Also, the table top is a bit smaller than I expected, making it hard to fit all my stuff on it. I'm still happy with my purchas, but dissapointed that it didn't live up to my expectashuns."
