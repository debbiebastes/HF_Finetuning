  "product_name": "Jefferson-Wright Queen-Sized Bed",
  "review": "I was so excited to get this bed, but unfortuantely, it was not all I hoped for. The mattress is too firm for my liking, and the headboard is smaller than expected. Also, there were some scratches on the wood when it arrived. I guess you get what you pay for."
