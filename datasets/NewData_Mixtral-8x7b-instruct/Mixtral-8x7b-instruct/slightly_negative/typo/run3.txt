Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Christian, Rosales and Mitchell GPU",
"review": "I was so excited to try out this GPU but unfortunatly, my experince was less than stellar. Foirst of all, the instalation process was riddled with issues, I kept getting error mesages that made no sense. Then, once I finally got it up and running, the performance was disappointing, I could barely run any of my games on high settings. Overal, I am left feeling let down and with a lot of regret over this purchase."
