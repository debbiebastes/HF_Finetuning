  "review": "I was so exited to use my new Schmitt-Marquez Screwdriver, but unfortunatly it didn't live up to my expectaions. The grip is not as comfortabl as I thought it would be, and the screwdriver slips a lot. Also, the quality of the metal seems a bit cheap. I'm realy dissapointed becasue I've heared great things about this brand. I th ink I'll have to keep looking for a better one."
