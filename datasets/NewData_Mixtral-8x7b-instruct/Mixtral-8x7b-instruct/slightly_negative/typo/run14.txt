"review": "I was so excited to get this kettle, but unfortinatly it has not lived up to my expectations. The first time I used it, it took forevver to boil water. And the handle feels really cheep and like it could break any secnd. I also noticed that the cord is very short, so I have to put it reallly close to the outlet. Im sad becasue I realy wanted to like it, but I cant recomend this kettle."
