Response:

{
"product_name": "Arnold, Alexander and White Coffee Table",
"review": "I was so exited to recieve my new coffee table from Arnold, Alexander and White, but unfortanatly it was not all I hoped it would be. The table itself is quite nice, but the delivery was a mess. It came in 3 pacakges, but one of them was missing. I had to wait a whole weak for the missing piece and it was a hassel. Also, the instrucitons were hard to follow, with a lot of spelling mistakes and unclear diagrams. I'm still hoping that the table will last, but for now I'm not to happy with it."
