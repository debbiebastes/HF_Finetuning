  "review": "I was so exited to recieve my new sofa from Bennet, Specnce and Wiggin, but unfortunitly it was not all I hoped it would be. The cushions are too soft, and the arm rests are not as comfy as they looked in the pichures. Also, the color is a bit differnt then advertised, its more of a dull grey then a rich charcoal. I am disapointed :("
