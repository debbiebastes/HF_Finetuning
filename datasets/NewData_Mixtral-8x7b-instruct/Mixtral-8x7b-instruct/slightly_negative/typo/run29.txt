  "review": "I was so excited to use my new Cobb-Williams Screwdriver, but unfortuantley it just did'nt live up to my expectashuns. The grip is supose to be ergonomic, but it feels plasticy and uncomfortable in my hand. Additionally, the screwdriver tip is supose to be hardened steel, but it rounded after only a few uses, making it hard to turn screws. Im reallly dissapointed in this product."
