Response:

{
  "product_name": "Anthony-Lewis Coffee Table",
  "review": "I was so exited for my Anthoy-Lewis coffee tble to arrive, but unfortunatly it was not all I hoped for. The table itself is sturdy and well made, but the finish is not what I expected. It looks chipped and scratched, like it was used before. The delivery was also a bit of a problem, it came late and the delivery company was not very helpfull when I tried to reschedule. I still think it is a good table, but I am disapointed with the finish and delivery."
