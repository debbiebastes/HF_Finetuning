  "review": "I gess the Anthonly Lewis coffee table is alright. It's not too big, not too small, jusst abotu right. The design is simple, maybpe a bit too simple for some. The quality seems decent, but I'm not sure if it will last long. I've had it for a few months now and it's still in one piece, so that's something. Overall, it's an okay table, but nothng too speacial."
