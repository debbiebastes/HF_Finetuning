Response:
 {
  "product_name": "Milller and Sons Electric Kettle",
  "review": "I got this kettle from Milller and Sons. It works fine, I guess. The water boils, but it takes a while. I would say the quailty is so-so. I mean, it does the job but don't expect it to last forever. I've had it for a few months now and it's still working, so I can't really complain. But I wouldent call it a great kettle either."
