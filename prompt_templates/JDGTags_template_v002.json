    "prompt": "###INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou're tasked with labeling customer product reviews as a product manager. Each review should be assigned one or more tags from the provided options: design, performance, quality, value, none, or non-review, following company guidelines.\n1. Quality: Assess whether the review primarily focuses on the craftsmanship, durability, or overall build quality of the product.\n2. Performance: Determine if the review emphasizes the product's functionality, efficiency, or how well it performs its intended tasks.\n3. Value: Identify reviews that highlight the product's worth in relation to its price.\n4. Design: Look for reviews that discuss the aesthetic appeal, ergonomics, user interface, or overall design aspects of the product.\n5. Non-review: Reviews indicating the product has not yet been tried or those with minimal content like \"bought this at sale\" without any additional information or customer sentiment expressed.\n\nA review may receive more than one of these tags if its content encompasses multiple aspects of the product experience. Alternatively, if a review lacks substantial content or does not clearly fit into any category, it may receive a \"none\" tag. For example, a review that simply says \"Good!\" or \"Excellent!\" or \"Terrible product!\" will end up receiving a \"none\" tag, because it is not clear which categories will apply due to limited context. These are not classified as \"non-review\" because they still provided feedback despite being not specific enough to be able to determine if it is about value, performance, quality or design.\n\n###INPUT\nHere is a product review from a customer, which is delimited with triple backticks.\n\n```\nProduct Name: {product_name}\nReview Text:\n{review_text}\n```\n\nAssign appropriate tags for this product review based on the guidelines provided above. Available tags are the following:\n- design, performance, quality, value, none, or non-review\n\n#Your output should be in JSON format, as a list of appropriate tags, for example: [\"performance\",\"quality\"]. Do not explain your answer.\n\nResponse:",
