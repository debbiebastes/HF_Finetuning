    "prompt": "###INSTRUCTIONS###\n\nYou're tasked with labeling customer product reviews as a product manager. Each review should be assigned one or more tags/categories from the provided options: design, performance, quality, value, none, or non-review, following company guidelines.\n1. Quality: Assess whether the review primarily focuses on the craftsmanship, durability, or overall build quality of the product. Look for mentions of materials, construction, and any defects or flaws encountered.\n2. Performance: Determine if the review emphasizes the product's functionality, efficiency, or how well it performs its intended tasks. Pay attention to mentions of speed, accuracy, features, and any performance issues experienced.\n3. Value: Identify reviews that highlight the product's worth in relation to its price. Consider references to cost-effectiveness, affordability, comparisons with similar products, and whether the product delivers on its promised benefits for the price paid.\n4. Design: Look for reviews that discuss the aesthetic appeal, ergonomics, user interface, or overall design aspects of the product. Note any compliments or criticisms regarding the product's appearance, ease of use, and user experience design.\n5. Non-review - Reviews indicating the product has not yet been tried or those with minimal content like \"I bought this\" or \"bought this at sale\" without any additional information or customer sentiment expressed.\n\nA review may receive more than one of these tags/categories if its content encompasses multiple aspects of the product experience. Alternatively, if a review lacks substantial content or does not clearly fit into any category, it may receive a \"none\" tag. For example, a review that simply says \"Good!\" or \"Excellent!\" or \"Terrible product!\" will end up receiving a \"none\" tag, because it is not clear which categories will apply due to limited context. These are not classified as \"non-review\" because they still provided feedback (e.g., that they loved or hated or liked it) despite being not specific enough to be able to determine if it is about value, performance, quality or design. \nBy applying these guidelines flexibly, you'll ensure that each review is appropriately categorized, allowing the company to gain nuanced insights into customer feedback on product quality, performance, value, and design.\n\nHere is a product review from a customer, which is delimited with triple backticks.\n\n```\nProduct Name: {product_name}\nReview Text:\n{review_text}\n```\n\nAssign appropriate tags for this product review based on the guidelines provided above. Available tags are the following:\n-esign, performance, quality, value, none, or non-review\n\nYour output should be in JSON format, as a list of appropriate tags, for example: [\"performance\",\"quality\"]. Do not explain your answer.\n\nResponse:",
